# 05-Space-shooter
A 2D shooter game in space where you control a ship that shoots enemies. Three UFO's spawn at a time, and 
after killing all three, they respawn signaling the start of a new level. Meteors are also spawning randomly.
Every time a new level is reached, their HP, damage, and fire rate increases and an extra meteor spawns per rotation.
The game ends when the player is out of HP, making everything on the screen disappear and displaying a game over 
message.

Sprites are from Kenney's Space Shooter Redux.
